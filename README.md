# Habit Warden

Habit Warden is the simplest way to track and reinforce your habits.

Based on principles learned from Atomic Habits, Principles, and Can't Hurt Me - we've taken a simple approach to making sure you become 1% better every single day.

WHY?

* We've heard you stop tracking after a few weeks when the stresses of life hit
* We've heard you have 142 different apps to become a better you, yet none of them stick
* We've heard the friction of tracking is the biggest barrier to tracking. And the biggest barrier to consistency is a lack of tracking
* We've heard you want to be lazy...but you want to be better. You can't be lazy in all aspects, but we hope Warden helps you to be lazy and successful at tracking the things you're not lazy at
