# Habit Warden

Habit Warden is the simplest way to track and reinforce your habits.

Based on principles learned from Atomic Habits, Principles, and Can't Hurt Me - we've taken a simple approach to making sure you become 1% better every single day.

WHY?

* We've heard you stop tracking after a few weeks when the stresses of life hit
* We've heard you have 142 different apps to become a better you, yet none of them stick
* We've heard the friction of tracking is the biggest barrier to tracking. And the biggest barrier to consistency is a lack of tracking
